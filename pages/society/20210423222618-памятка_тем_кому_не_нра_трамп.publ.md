> "Some useful advice from Francesc Torres about the present state of things.
> 
> Thank you, Fransesc.
> 
> Worth to consider.
> 
> 1.  Don't use his name;
> 2.  Remember this is a regime and he's not acting alone;
> 3.  Focus on his policies, not his orange-ness and mental state;
> 4.  Keep your message positive; they want the country to be angry and fearful because this is the soil from which their darkest policies will grow;
> 5.  No more helpless/hopeless talk;
> 6.  Support artists and the arts;
> 7.  Be careful not to spread fake news. Check it;
> 8.  Take care of yourselves; and
> 9.  Resist!
> 
> Keep demonstrations peaceful. In the words of John Lennon, "When it gets down to having to use violence, then you are playing the system’s game. The establishment will irritate you - pull your beard, flick your face - to make you fight! Because once they’ve got you violent, then they know how to handle you. The only thing they don’t know how to handle is non-violence and humour."
> 
> When you post or talk about him, don't assign his actions to him, assign them to "The Republican Administration," or "The Republicans." This will have several effects: the Republican legislators will either have to take responsibility for their association with him or stand up for what some of them don't like; he will not get the focus of attention he craves; Republican representatives will become very concerned about their re-elections."
